This directory contains customization resources to adapt editors to Unicon.
Each editor has a brief set of instructions to help with installation.

GNU Emacs: unicon.el
--------------------

To install the unicon major mode you need to alter your startup file (~/.emacs)
to tell Emacs that .icn files are handled by unicon.el and where to find the
file.

You can either leave the file where it is installed by default, or move it to
your site-lisp directory. Here is a simple example of what to add to your .emacs
file (for Windows, assuming the Unicon installation is in the default place).

;;; Unicon customisation
;; The next line is not required if unicon.el is in site-lisp
(setq load-path (append load-path '("c:\\unicon\\config\\editor")))
(require 'unicon)
;; Define the mode for .icn files
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.icn\\'" . unicon-mode) auto-mode-alist))

In the example above the unicon mode is "pre-loaded" by the require function.
If you choose not to pre-load it, The easiest way to load the unicon major mode
is to visit a unicon file with the extension .icn.

Once the Unicon major mode is loaded, it may be further customized by
   M-x customize-mode
and specifying unicon in response to the "Mode:" prompt.

Further information about the emacs startup file and how to customize
it is contained in the emacs manual under "Customization", which is at
the end of the "Advanced Features" section of the manual.  Use C-h i
to access the manual.
