# bug 883864 - from Steve Wampler
#
# The bug is that an initialization supplied in the class field list is
# ignored. The initially has parameters after it, and this empty parameter
# list subsumes/replaces the use of the class field list as a parameter list.
# It should: initialize to "a value" and then override that to "A value" and
# write that out.
#
class Aclass(avalue:"a value")

    method showValue()
	write(avalue)
    end

initially()
    avalue := "A value"
end

procedure main()
    a := Aclass()
    a.showValue()
end
