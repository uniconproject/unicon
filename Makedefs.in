#  XPMDEFS  definitions for building XPM library

# Note: -lsocket is not available on some Linux systems,

# Useful development flags: -g -Wall -Wno-missing-braces -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer
# -g and -fsanitize=address should also be added to the linker flags
# make sure to also change the optimization to level 0 or 1
