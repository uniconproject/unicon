Rabbit becomes public domain

Hi all!

On behalf of Cryptico A/S, the company who designed the Rabbit stream cipher, I'm happy to relay the following:

"Rabbit has been released into the public domain and may be used freely for
any purpose."

So in retrospect, I think that it was a good decision not to make patent issues a key criterion for the eStream portfolio: The patent status can change, the algorithmic properties can't.

Best regards

Erik Zenner

I can confirm that there is a bug in the third line in the first three test vectors in the file test-vectors.txt inside rabbit_p3source.zip.

See the thread "Question about RABBIT Test-Vector" in this forum for more information.

Best regards,
Martin Boesgaard
