System configuration:

	Hewlett-Packard Precision RISC architecture running HP-UX

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 11.0

Installer:

	Unicon Project

Known bugs:

	None

Comments:

	Configured (without graphics, likely needs tweaks for X11) on
	HP-UX 11.11.

	HP/UX uses the LPATH environment variable as a path to the linker.
	This conflicts with the use of LPATH in link declarations under
	Icon and Unicon.
