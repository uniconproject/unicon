/* Add a new element to the database.  CONTENT is keyed by KEY.  The
   file on disk is updated to reflect the structure of the new database
   before returning from this procedure.  The FLAGS define the action to
   take when the KEY is already in the database.  The value GDBM_REPLACE
   asks that the old data be replaced by the new CONTENT.  The value
   GDBM_INSERT asks that an error be returned and no action taken.  A
   return value of 0 means no errors.  A return value of -1 means that
   the item was not stored in the data base because the caller was not an
   official writer. A return value of 0 means that the item was not stored
   because the argument FLAGS was GDBM_INSERT and the KEY was already in
