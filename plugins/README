Unicon Plugins - February 2017
------------------------------

This directory is home for Unicon's official shared/loadable objects and their
sources. This is where some of the new experimental features are added that
eventually could be moved to be part of the language, or those features that are
deemed to be nonessential to be added as built-in to the language. Contributions
are welcome. If you plan to contribute a new feature in the form of a shared
object please follow the guidelines below as this makes it easier for us to
integrate them with our build system on various platforms.

1- Make sure every source file has a licence at the top
2- Please use consistent formatting across your source files
3- Add rules to the make file to build your shared library

Note that, as of August 2019, there are now two different kinds of additional
features:
	Conventional plugins, as before.
	Random Number Generator (RNG) shared libraries.

The RNG libraries are implemented differently to a conventional plugin and each
library is located in a separate subdirectory of plugins/rngLibraries. The
simplest example is in plugins/rngLibraries/rngIconEx, which contains a
re-implementation of the built-in (Icon) generator as a shared library.
The "Ex" may be interpreted as "External" or "Example" (or both).

Note that, for any shared RNG library to work, your implementation of Unicon
must be built with the symbol RngLibrary defined.
