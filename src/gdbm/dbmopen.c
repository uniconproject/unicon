/* Initialize ndbm system.  FILE is a pointer to the file name.  In
   standard dbm, the database is found in files called FILE.pag and
   FILE.dir.  To make gdbm compatable with dbm using the dbminit call,
   the same file names are used.  Specifically, dbminit will use the file
   name FILE.pag in its call to gdbm open.  If the file (FILE.pag) has a
   size of zero bytes, a file initialization procedure is performed,
   setting up the initial structure in the file.  Any error detected will
   cause a return value of -1.  No errors cause the return value of 0.
   NOTE: file.dir will be ignored and will always have a size of zero.
   FLAGS and MODE are the same as the open (2) call.  This call will
   look at the FLAGS and decide what call to make to gdbm_open.  For
   FLAGS == O_RDONLY, it will be a GDBM_READER, if FLAGS == O_RDWR|O_CREAT,
   it will be a GDBM_WRCREAT (creater and writer) and if the FLAGS == O_RDWR,
   it will be a GDBM_WRITER and if FLAGS contain O_TRUNC then it will be
   a GDBM_NEWDB.  All other values of FLAGS in the flags are
   ignored. */
