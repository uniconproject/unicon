Comments:

	I used the sun4_solaris and i386_svr4 configruations as starting
	points. The following comment was inherited from sun4_solaris:

	  This configuration uses no Berkeley or SunOS 4.x compatibility
	  files; it was built with PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin.
	  The Makefiles assume that OpenWindows is in /usr/openwin.
