Unicon 10.0 README


This is the Unicon pre-prelease distribution.  Please tell us
where it compiles, and and when and how it doesn't.

This distribution unpacks into a directory hierarchy per the Icon source
distribution, with additions. General instructions for building Icon
sources apply; see their technical report if you need it.


Supported Platforms		Mostly Supported Platforms
----------------------------------------------------------
intel_linux
sun4_gcc
sgi_irix			other UNIX
sun4_solaris
MS Windows95 and above


Sample install:

unzip uni.zip				# maybe you've done this already
make X-Configure name=intel_linux	# use your OS name from config/unix
make Unicon

Should create a bin directory.  Total success will place icont, iconx,
unicon, and ivib in that directory.

Tips: Your platform may need custom tweaking if it doesn't have an
<ndbm.h>; if your NDBM library has a 1024 byte limit you will not
be able to build ivib. Use the supplied gdbm, or your own, to get
around system ndbm issues.
