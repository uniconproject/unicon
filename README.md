```
Source distribution is also available for download on unicon.org.

Build Instructions
-----------------

To build Unicon from sources follow the standard autoconf procedure:

```
./configure
make

```
Run configure --help for configuration steps. You can also invoke
make with -jN to run a faster/parallel build using up to N threads.

Total success will place programs named icont, iconx, unicon, ivib and ui
in a subdirectory named unicon/bin/, which you can add to your path or alternatively
you can install Unicon on your system by doing:

```
make install
```
