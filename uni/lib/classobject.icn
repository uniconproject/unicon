# Purpose: This provides a generalised object value and object algebra      #
#          facility for use in other classes and objects. It is based       #
#          on the ErrorSystem class for common error handling               #
#          facilities.                                                      #

#          This is the auxiliary superclass for the Unicon Projects packages#
#          and is used in conjunction with the errorsystem.icn classes as   #
#          a part of these packages.                                        #
#                                                                           #

#: As such, each level will be in its own package to ensure that there is no crossover

#
#   General comments:
#
# The way I envisage this to work is the creation of a pair of classes, one that
# represents the class and one that represents all of the objects of that class.
# One of the operations/methods of the "class" class it has is New(). This method
# will create the objects that are members of the class, with the class definition
# containing methods that are specific to the class and each of the obejcts
# having methods specific to the objects
#
# We shall see how this may outwork.
#
# An example would be the class Matrix which has the generic Vector methods and
# all the actual vector objects being of class __MatrixObject which has the relevant
# object specific methods. In terms of association required, an example in terms
# a general layout is as follows:
#
#   package Matrix
#
#   import ClassObject
#
#   class Matrix : ClassClass(... parameters required)
#
#       list of class specific methods
#
#   initially()
#       if not AlreadyRun(Matrix::Matrix) then {
#           Execute(ClassObject::ClassClass)
#           SetClass(Matrix::__MatrixObject)
#           Off()
#           Matrix::Matrix := self
#       }
#   end
#
#   class __MatrixObject : ClassObject(... list of object specific parameters)
#
#       list of object specific methods
#
#   initially(list of paramters)
#       ...
#
#   end
#
#
# the execution of Matrix::Matrix.New(... paramaters) will create an object of
# Matrix::__MatrixObject
#
#

#CD:
#: class ClassClass - This class is used as a parent of all classes that provides
#: general facilities for an associated object class. This is intended to allow
#: a generic class object to be able to create new objects (specified by an
#: associated class) by the use of a standardised New() method.
#:
#:
#: My intent is to allow the migration of specific Javascript and Python systems
#: that I am interested in to Unicon. I want to showcase the Unicon version and how
#: the Unicon language allows a better coding practice. We shall see if this
#: attempt works in a practical way.

#: The generic design of the "class" classes is highlighted in the initially()
#: method below. It ensures that no matter how many subclasses a class may end up
#: having the initially() method is only run once and only one class object is
#: created for the relevant class. This means that the class name refers to the
#: relevant object directly without having to use the function call method.
#:
#: We only want the initially method to be run once ever and even with the class
#: name no longer pointing to the relevant code, it is still possible to execute
#: the class initially code from within a subclass using the superclass method
#: call protocol. Therefore, we check to see if the class name now holds an object
#: or is still the original procedure.
#:
#: This is unlike the methodology that the classes of Steve Wampler uses.
#: In those cases, the class name is associated with a co-expression and each call
#: to the class is via the function call process. In his classes, this always
#: returns the same object.

    # simplification of the entire process. At this point, it must be noted that
