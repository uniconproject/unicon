This directory hasn't changed since 04-Sep-2001 (commit 61fbde69). The contents
are probably obsolete. In particular, the version of icall.h here dates from
984fa078  05-May-2001 | Introduction of the Unicon source tree onto Source Forge.

If any attempt is made to resurrect this material, the first task should be to
remove icall.h from this directory and to use the modern version that is located
at uni/icall/icall.h

Other modifications are likely to be required.

Previous README contents...

This directory contains some demonstrations of loadfunc().
Some more generally useful C functions are provided in the ipl/cfuncs
directory, and some of these test drivers depend on them.

Set IPATH and FPATH, then type "make" to build everything.

The C functions are as follows:
    argdump	print arguments on standard output
    cspgen	cellular automata ager for "cspace" (below)
    ddump	dump descriptor in hexadecimal

The Icon programs are as follows:
    btest	simple demo using bitcount() from cfuncs library
    cspace	cellular automata demonstration; opens a graphics window
    ddtest	simple demo using ddump()
    dldemo	simple demo using argdump()
    newsgrp	connect to news server and print subjects from a newsgroup
    tnet	very simple telnet client

Further information is contained in the comments in the individual files.
