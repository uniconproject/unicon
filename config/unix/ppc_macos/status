System configuration:

	Apple Macintosh running MacOS X (10.1 or newer)

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 11.0

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Unicon Project

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.  The "cfuncs" test will fail.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	Unicon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.

	A Unicon installation with graphics requires the presence
	of XFree86, at present a free download from www.apple.com

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure"
	instead of "make X-Configure" when building.

	Built with MacOS 10.1 and not very well tested yet.
