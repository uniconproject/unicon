This directory contains programs and scripts for benchmarking
Icon.  The whole thing can be done with

	make benchmark

Notes:

In order for the benchmarks to be compared meaningfully to benchmarks
from other computers, the Icon string and block region sizes must
be consistent.  The output shows the values used.

The benchmarks normally are run with normal program output turned off
to prevent the results from being affected by i/o factors. Output can be
turned on by setting the environment variable OUTPUT. Timings with output
turned on generally cannot be compared meaningfully to benchmarks from
other platforms.

Benchmarking is contingent on Icon running properly. Output from benchmark-
ing icont on a Sun 4/490 is contained in the files *.std, and can be used for
comparison if there is any doubt.
