System configuration:

	Apple Intel-based Macintosh running MacOS X (10.4 or newer)

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 11.4

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Unicon Project

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.  The "cfuncs" test will fail.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	Extremely preliminary, not yet tested!

	A Unicon installation with graphics requires the presence
	of XFree86, at present a free download from www.apple.com

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure name=intel_macos"
	instead of "make X-Configure name=intel_macos" when building.
